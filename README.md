# GREAT DAYS 2025 - Event Platform

Welcome! This is the code for the Great Days 2025 landing page.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project (The Easy Way)

Since you are new to this, here is a step-by-step guide to get the website running on your computer.

### 1. Open the Terminal
You usually have a terminal window at the bottom of your code editor (VS Code). If you don't see it, press \`Ctrl + \`\` (the key above Tab).

### 2. Start the Website
Type this command in the terminal and press **Enter**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will see a message like:
`➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/`

### 3. View the Website
Hold **Ctrl** and **Click** that link (`http://localhost:5173/`), or open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and type `http://localhost:5173/` in the address bar.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" or errors?**
If `npm run dev` doesn't work, you might need to install the "dependencies" (the software tools the project needs) first.

Run this command once:
```bash
npm install
```
Wait for it to finish, then try `npm run dev` again.

## 🛑 How to Stop
To stop the website, click in the terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.
